A basic authentication starter kit using [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/master), [Intertia.js](https://inertiajs.com/), [PrimeVue](https://primevue.org/) components, and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

[Hosted Demo Project](https://laravel-primevue-starter-kit-demo-master-yhjxow.laravel.cloud/)

Do you need a separate Vue SPA front-end instead of using Inertia.js? Consider using the [Vue SPA w/ PrimeVue & Laravel Breeze API Starter Kit](https://github.com/connorabbas/primevue-spa-laravel-api) instead.

## Roadmap
- [x] Hosted demo project
- [x] Updated User profile settings pages (similar to official Laravel starter kits)
- [x] Additional layouts (similar to official Laravel starter kits)
- [ ] Alternative admin branch using either [Filament PHP](https://filamentphp.com/) or [spatie/laravel-permission](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-permission/v6/introduction)
- [ ] Proper SSR support
- [ ] Update `connorabbas/primevue-spa-laravel-api` project to match UI/functionality

## Features

-   Pre-configured [Auto Import](https://primevue.org/autoimport/) PrimeVue components
-   Wrapper components for PrimeVue's `Breadcrumb`, `Menu`, `MenuBar`, & `PanelMenu` utilizing Inertia's `Link` component
-   `usePaginatedData()` & `useLazyDataTable()` composables for use with PrimeVue's `Paginator` & `DataTable` components for easy pagination/filtering/sorting (example usage in `feature/admin-panel` branch)
-   Light/dark/system color mode toggle
-   Easily customizable theming
-   Opt-in TypeScript usage

## Theme

This starter kit provides a collection of custom theme presets to choose from, built using the powerful **PrimeVue V4** theming system. It leverages styled mode and custom design token values to create flexible and cohesive UI designs.

### Prebuilt Theme Presets

The prebuilt theme presets are located in the `/resources/js/theme` directory. Each preset offers a distinct visual style:

-   **noir**  
    A minimal, monochromatic theme that serves as the default style.

-   **bootstrap**  
    Emulates the familiar look and feel of [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

-   **breeze**  
    Captures the aesthetic of [Laravel Breeze](https://github.com/laravel/breeze).

-   **enterprise**  
    Provides a clean, no-nonsense corporate design.

### Customizing Your Own Theme

Creating your own theme preset is simple. You can:

-   Swap the [primary](https://primevue.org/theming/styled/#primary) values with a different set of [colors](https://primevue.org/theming/styled/#colors).
-   Adjust the `colorScheme` [surface](https://primevue.org/theming/styled/#surface) values (e.g., slate, gray, neutral).
-   Change the extended [preset theme](https://primevue.org/theming/styled/#presets).

For detailed guidance on customization, please refer to the [PrimeVue Styled Mode Docs](https://primevue.org/theming/styled/).

### PrimeVue v4 w/ Tailwind CSS

To clarify, Tailwind is **not** used for any component styling in this starter kit; instead, we use PrimeVue's styled mode with a custom theme preset implementation for component styling. Tailwind is applied solely for layout purposes **around** PrimeVue components and for minimal styling when needed.

## Usage with Docker

This starter kit is configured to use Docker Compose for local development with just a few extra steps, powered by images & configuration from [Laravel Sail](https://laravel.com/docs/master/sail). With this setup, you do not need PHP, Composer, PostgreSQL or Node.js installed on your machine to get up and running with this project.

### Setup

1. In a new directory (outside of your Laravel project) create a `docker-compose.yml` file to create a reverse proxy container using [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/getting-started/quick-start/). You can clone/reference this [example implementation](https://github.com/connorabbas/traefik-docker-compose/blob/master/docker-compose.yml).

2. Step into the directory containing the new compose file, and spin up the Traefik container:
    ```
    docker compose up -d
    ```
3. Update Laravel app `.env`

    ```env
    # Use any desired domain ending with .localhost
    # Match with value used in docker-compose.local.yml
    APP_URL=http://laravel-primevue.localhost

    DB_CONNECTION=pgsql
    DB_HOST=pgsql # name of service
    DB_PORT=5432
    DB_DATABASE=laravel
    DB_USERNAME=sail
    DB_PASSWORD=password

    # Update port values as needed when running multiple projects/services
    APP_PORT=8000
    VITE_PORT=5173
    FORWARD_DB_PORT=5432
    ```

4. Build the Laravel app container using one of the following techniques:
    - Build manually using docker compose CLI (like above)
    - Use [Laravel Sail](https://laravel.com/docs/master/sail)
    - Build as a [VS Code Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/tutorial) using the `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container` command

### Additional configuration

If you wish to add additional services, or swap out PostgreSQL with an alternative database, you can reference the [Laravel Sail stubs](https://github.com/laravel/sail/tree/1.x/stubs) and update the `docker-compose.local.yml` file as needed.
